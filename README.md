# clickhouse-snowflake-http-proxy
Clickhouse to Snowflake Proxy using the Clickhouse HTTP API

Very minimal example using FASTAPI. 

Still need to add authentication passthrough and many other things, but hey it is a start


Currently as it is all bare bornes, you need to add your Snowflake account authentication in the code. 

Will handle via config file soon
